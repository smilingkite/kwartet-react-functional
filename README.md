# Kwartet

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a two player version of Kwartet in the browser. The game logic is programmed mostly using functional programming, in preparation for implementing Redux. 

Previous versions were made with a different data structure in:
* [Node](https://github.com/smilingkite/kwartet)
* [React](https://github.com/smilingkite/kwartet-react)
